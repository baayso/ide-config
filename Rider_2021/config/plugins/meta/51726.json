The output from the process replaces the selection with <b>stderr</b> and <b>stdout</b>. Works with multiple carets by piping each selection region separately into their own process. Also works with no carets.</p>\n<p><b>General usage instructions</b>\nInvoke with ctrl-alt-shift-x, or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show the context menu. The menu item is called <b>Pipe selected text to bash</b>. When no lines are selected, use the keyboard shortcut to open the bash argument window.</p>\n<p><b>Demo</b>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yajQkJf.gif\" alt=\"example\"></p>\n<p><b>Features</b>\n</p><ul><li>Remembers the last command arguments</li><li>Treats output containing either stderr and stdout the same</li><li>Works with multiple carets, 1 caret and no carets</li><li>Bug-free on Linux and Windows</li><li>Actively supported - <a href=\"https://github.com/profbear/pipeprofen/issues\" rel=\"nofollow\"> open an issue on github</a></li><li>Unlicensed, free public domain source</li></ul><p></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> you must have bash in your environment's PATH.</p>\n<p>Being able to run anything in the editor and change the buffer text was heavily inspired by emacs's lisp expressions <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval\" rel=\"nofollow\">(eval-last-sexp), (eval-defun) and (eval-expression)</a>.
